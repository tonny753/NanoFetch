As a legitimate file published by Microsoft, it is generally considered safe and not classified as a virus or malware; however, users should always ensure that it is running from the correct directory, typically located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder, to avoid potential security risks from malicious software that may masquerade under the same name. While most users report a smooth experience with Microsoft.Wallet.exe, some may encounter errors related to compatibility, performance issues, or crashes, which can often be resolved through system updates, reinstallation of the application, or troubleshooting methods such as checking for corrupted system files. It is advisable for users to keep their operating system updated and to run regular malware scans to maintain overall system security.
